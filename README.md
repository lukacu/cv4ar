# Computer Vision for Augmented Reality

Demos for marker-based AR, designed to explain some underlaying computer vision algorithms. Demos are using OpenCV 3.x library and are compiled using CMake.

# Basic image processing

## Thresholding

## Filtering

## Edge detection

# Binary marker

## Contours

## Binary marker detection

## Homography estimation

## Pose estimation

# Key-points for texture detection

## Key-points

## Correspondences

## RANSAC
